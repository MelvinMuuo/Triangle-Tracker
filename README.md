## Description
Triangle-Tracker is an application that helps the user know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all. The user enters length values of the three sides of the triangle in the application.
After submitting their values, the application tells them what type of triangle the values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
*  Copy the URL (either select the text and copy it manually, or click on the clipboard button next to the URL), and you will clone the repository using the git clone command in the terminal.
 
## Technologies Used
This project was created using:
  -CSS.
  -HTML.
  -Javascript.
## Behavior-Driven Development 
BDD is a common process in which the developer's focus begins on the behaviors that they want to see in their final application rather than thinking first about the code.

The criteria that must be considered to determine the type of triangle are:
  -If all the sides are equal then it is an equilateral triangle.
  -If any two sides are exactly equal then it is isosceles triangle.
  -If none of the sides are equal and the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side then it is a scalene triangle.
  -If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.
